Emurate uses for PostgreSQL advisory locks here.

Since the locks PostgreSQL offers are by integer values instead of by a textual
key, it is desirable to list their use in a central place to avoid confusion or
collision.  

For inventing new lock numbers, I suggest random.randint(1, 2**30)

Note that locks can either be requested using a single 8 byte integer, or two 4
byte integers.  Using the second form, the first integer typically acts as a
namespace.
